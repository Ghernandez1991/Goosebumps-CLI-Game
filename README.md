# Goosebumps-CLI-Game
A terminal based, choose your own adventure game. Based on the 90's 'Goosebumps' series. 




INSTALL
Users who do a git pull will need to pip install the requirments.txt file in their virtual environment. For users with a completely clean environment(except for pip) will likely also need to install the YAML package. During testing, that seems to be a dependency that the requirments.txt file needs. 

YAML can be found here. 
https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/

This choose your own adventure game is based in the command line. Users are dumped into a themepark with attactions they can choose from. Each attaction features its own challenges and traps where the user may die. 


Viewer beware, you're in for a scare.
